# Can I Watch It?


## Description
A simple way to see what subscription services offer the movie you want! Our motivation for this project is the amount of time wasted searching through the many streaming subscriptions available just to find the one movie you want to watch. Can I Watch It? cuts out the middleman. This project allows you to search for your desired film in the streaming service you have, all on one page. With this application, there is no excuse to fall asleep before the closing credits. With our project, we created the most efficient way find your movie. We learned how to apply more than one API to an application and how to collaborate as a team.
